    "### Hosting a HuggingFace model in Amazon Sagemaker\n",
    "#### This notebook runs on both GPU and CPU, but it runs faster on a GPU since it has an NLP nerual network model in it and it is used twice prior to hosting: to generate word embeddings and to test the model locally. Measured end-2-end runtimes are: ml.p3.2xlarge: 9.5 minutes. ml.c5.4xlarge: 18.5 minutes. Your mileage may vary.\n",
    "#### This notebook pulls a BERT model from HuggingFace repo to demonstrate a Semantic Search use-case.  \n",
    "#### In addition, this notebook demonstrates the following capabilities:\n",
    "* how to add extra artifacts to the pretrained model.tar.gz, such as word embeddings, for example. \n",
    "* how to pull a container from ECR.\n",
    "* how to add custom inference.py “entry point” script, as well as additional files/directories to be used during inference process.\n",
    "* how to add dependencies (eg requirements.txt) to be executed at upon launching the container.\n",
    "* how to set up environment variables to allow the code inside inference container to access content outside of VPC. for example. \n",
    "* how to deploy the model \n",
    "* how to invoke the model.\n",
    "* how to call CloudWatch via Python APIs to obtain model invocation metrics such as model and overhead latency.  "

    "#### Semantic Search is a searching technique which incorporates contextual meaning of words or phrases. It relies on offline convertion of the corpus of data into word embeddings using (in this example) a distilbert model. During a real-time search (i.e. \"model inference\"), a query is also converted into an embedding using the same distilbert model. Query_embedding is then ranked against all embeddings of the corpus using cosine similarity and the top-ranked matches are presented . In this simplified example, corpus embeddings are included in the same tarball as the model itself. Including the corpus in the model's tarball file is obviously is not a scalable solution as it is limited by the available memory and compute power of the inference endpoint. A scalable solution would involve using Elastic Search instead.\n",
