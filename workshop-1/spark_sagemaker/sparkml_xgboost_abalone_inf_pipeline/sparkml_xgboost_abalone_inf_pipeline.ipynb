    "In many cases, when the trained model is used for processing real time or batch prediction requests, the model receives data in a format which needs to pre-processed (e.g. featurized) before it can be passed to the algorithm. In the following notebook, we will demonstrate how you can build your ML Pipeline leveraging Spark Feature Transformers and SageMaker XGBoost algorithm & after the model is trained, deploy the Pipeline (Feature Transformer and XGBoost) as an Inference Pipeline behind a single Endpoint for real-time inference and for batch inferences using Amazon SageMaker Batch Transform.\n",
