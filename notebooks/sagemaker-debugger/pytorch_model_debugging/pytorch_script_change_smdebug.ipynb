    "## How does Amazon SageMaker Debugger work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Debugger lets you go beyond just looking at scalars like losses and accuracies during training and gives you full visibility into all tensors 'flowing through the graph' during training. Furthermore, it helps you monitor your training in real time using rules and CloudWatch events and react to issues like, for example, common training issues such as vanishing gradients or poor weight initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "![debugger_overview](images/debug_image_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Output Tensor**: These are the artifacts that define the state of the training job at any particular instant in its lifecycle.\n",
    "* **Debug Hook**: Captures the tensors flowing through the training computational graph every N steps.\n",
    "* **Debugging Rule**: Logic to analyze the tensors captured by the hook and report anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these concepts in mind, let's understand the overall flow of things which Amazon SageMaker Debugger uses to orchestrate debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "It operates in two steps - saving tensors and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "![debugger_sysarch](images/debug_system_arch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors that debug hook captures are stored in S3 location specified by you. There are two ways you can configure Amazon SageMaker Debugger for storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **Zero code change**: If you use any of SageMaker provided [Deep Learning containers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pre-built-containers-frameworks-deep-learning.html) then you don't need to make any changes to your training script for tensors to be stored. Amazon SageMaker Debugger will use the configuration you provide in the framework `Estimator` to save tensors in the fashion you specify.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       **Note**: In case of PyTorch training, Debugger collects output tensors in GLOBAL mode by default. In other words, this option does not distinguish output tensors from different phases within an epoch, such as training phase and validation phase.\n",
    "       \n",
    "   2. **Script change**: Use the SageMaker Debugger client library, SMDebug, and customize training scripts to save the specific tensors you want at different frequencies and configurations. Refer to the [DeveloperGuide](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/tree/master/docs) for details on how to use SageMaker Debugger with your choice of framework in your training script.\n",
    "   \n",
    "In this notebook, we choose the second option to properly save the output tensors from different training phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Once tensors are saved, Amazon SageMaker Debugger can be configured to run debugging ***Rules*** on them. On a very broad level, a rule is a python script used to detect certain conditions during training. Some of the conditions that a data scientist training an algorithm might be interested in are monitoring for gradients getting too large or too small, detecting overfitting, and so on. Amazon SageMaker Debugger comes pre-packaged with certain built-in rules. You can also write your own rules using the Amazon SageMaker Debugger APIs. You can also analyze raw tensor data outside the Rules construct in a notebook, using Amazon SageMaker Debugger's full set of APIs.\n",
